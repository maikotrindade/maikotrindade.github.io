## Introduction

What if you could see exactly what stocks members of Congress are buying and selling—before the market fully reacts? What if artificial intelligence could analyze these public transactions in real-time and identify patterns that might inform your investment strategy?

Welcome to **[Capitol Trades Tracker](https://maikotrindade.com/capitol-trades-tracker/)**, a groundbreaking mobile application that combines the power of **agentic AI**, **multiple large language models (LLMs)**, and **public government data** to democratize access to political trading intelligence.

In an era where information asymmetry creates unfair advantages, Capitol Trades Tracker levels the playing field by making publicly disclosed congressional stock transactions not just visible, but *understandable* through cutting-edge AI analysis.

## The Problem: Public Data, Hidden Insights

Federal law requires U.S. congressional members to disclose their stock transactions. This data is public, yet it remains largely inaccessible to everyday investors. The information exists in scattered government databases, difficult to parse, and nearly impossible to analyze at scale without sophisticated tools.

Meanwhile, institutional investors and hedge funds employ teams of analysts to monitor this exact data, looking for patterns that might indicate market-moving information. This creates a significant advantage for those with resources—until now.

## The Solution: AI Agents Meet Public Transparency

Capitol Trades Tracker bridges this gap by combining three powerful elements:

### 1. **Comprehensive Data Aggregation**
Every publicly disclosed stock transaction made by congressional members is automatically collected, normalized, and made accessible through an intuitive mobile interface. Users can see:
- Who traded (politician, office, district)
- What they traded (stock symbols, asset types)
- Transaction details (buy/sell, amount ranges, dates)
- Disclosure timing (transaction date vs. public filing date)

### 2. **Koog-Powered AI Agents**
At the heart of Capitol Trades Tracker is an intelligent AI agent built with **[Koog](https://koog.ai)**, a cutting-edge framework for developing autonomous AI agents. This isn't just simple data retrieval—it's sophisticated, multi-layered analysis that:

- **Continuously monitors** official government disclosure databases in real-time
- **Processes and analyzes** trading patterns using advanced algorithms
- **Generates actionable insights** in human-readable format
- **Adapts and learns** from market outcomes and political contexts

### 3. **Multi-LLM Intelligence**
The system leverages **multiple large language models** to provide diverse analytical perspectives. Different LLMs bring different strengths:
- Some excel at pattern recognition across historical data
- Others specialize in contextual analysis of current events and pending legislation
- Advanced models provide sophisticated risk assessment and investment implications

For complete transparency, each AI-generated insight displays which LLM model performed the analysis, ensuring users understand the source and methodology behind every recommendation.

## How the AI Technology Works

### The Agentic Architecture

Unlike traditional applications that simply display data, Capitol Trades Tracker employs **agentic AI**—autonomous intelligent systems that can:

1. **Perceive**: Monitor multiple data sources continuously, including official disclosure records, market data, and news feeds
2. **Reason**: Apply complex analytical frameworks to identify unusual patterns, timing anomalies, and potential insider signals
3. **Act**: Generate daily insights, flag significant trades, and deliver personalized notifications
4. **Learn**: Improve analysis quality over time based on market outcomes

### Multi-LLM Ensemble Approach

The Koog-based backend orchestrates multiple LLMs in an ensemble approach:

```
Congressional Trading Data → Koog AI Agent → [LLM-1: Pattern Analysis]
                                           → [LLM-2: Contextual Assessment]  → Daily Insight
                                           → [LLM-3: Risk Evaluation]
```

This multi-model strategy ensures:
- **Robust analysis** that isn't dependent on a single model's limitations
- **Diverse perspectives** on the same trading activity
- **Cross-validation** of significant findings
- **Reduced bias** through consensus mechanisms

### Daily Intelligence Generation

Every day, the AI agent generates fresh insights by:

1. **Scanning** all new congressional trading disclosures
2. **Analyzing** patterns in transaction timing, volume, and assets
3. **Correlating** trades with pending legislation, industry trends, and market conditions
4. **Assessing** whether trades might indicate advance knowledge
5. **Synthesizing** findings into actionable investment intelligence

Each insight is delivered in clear markdown format with:
- Executive summary of key findings
- Detailed analysis of significant trades
- Potential investment implications
- Risk considerations
- Supporting context and reasoning
