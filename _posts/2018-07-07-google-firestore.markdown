As the [official Firestore docs] says, Firestore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. While the Cloud Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.
