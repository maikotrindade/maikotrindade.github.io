Last week, I had the privilege of presenting at [The Test Tribe 12th Calgary Meetup], hosted at the Neo Financial office in Calgary. The event, held on November 28, 2024, brought together an amazing community of testers and developers passionate about creating better user experiences.

During the session, titled "Creating Inclusive Experiences: A Guide to Accessibility in Android Apps with Jetpack Compose," I delved into the vital role accessibility plays in shaping a truly universal user experience. We explored topics such as:

The challenges faced by users with disabilities, including visual, mobility, cognitive, and hearing impairments.
The accessibility services provided by Android, like [TalkBack], Switch Access, and Voice Access.
Practical guidelines for creating inclusive designs, such as optimizing touch targets, simplifying gestures, and ensuring sufficient color contrast.
Tools and methods for testing accessibility, including manual testing with TalkBack and automated testing using semantics in Jetpack Compose.
The presentation also included practical demonstrations of accessibility testing, featuring examples from an app I created specifically to highlight accessibility issues and solutions ([InaccessibleApp]).

### Why Accessibility Matters
As the [World Health Organization] notes, over 1.3 billion people live with some form of disability. Accessibility isn’t just about compliance; it’s about empathy and inclusion. By leveraging Jetpack Compose’s accessibility tools, we can build Android apps that make everyone feel welcome and empowered.

### Thank You to the Community
I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the organizers, attendees, and everyone who made this event possible. The energy in the room was fantastic, with engaging questions and thoughtful discussions. It was a delightful evening where we all learned so much about building better, more inclusive experiences.

Looking forward to more opportunities to share knowledge and grow together with this vibrant community!
