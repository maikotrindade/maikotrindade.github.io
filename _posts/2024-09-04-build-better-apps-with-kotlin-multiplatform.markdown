title: Build Better Apps with Kotlin Multiplatform for Android & iOS
layout: post
---


In the ever-evolving world of mobile app development, creating seamless experiences across Android and iOS is no small feat. Traditionally, developers have had to choose between platform-specific native development, which provides the best performance and user experience but involves duplicate efforts, or cross-platform solutions like [React Native], [Flutter], or Xamarin, which promise "write once, run everywhere" with some compromises.

[Kotlin Multiplatform] (KMP) takes a unique approach by enabling code sharing while retaining native capabilities, making it a compelling choice for modern developers. Let’s dive into the benefits of KMP for [Android] and [iOS] development, compare it with other alternatives, and explore why KMP might be the right fit for your next project.

### What is Kotlin Multiplatform?
Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a feature of Kotlin, a programming language developed by JetBrains and widely adopted for Android development. Unlike other cross-platform tools that require you to build the entire application using their framework, KMP focuses on sharing business logic, network code, and data layers while allowing you to write platform-specific UI code. This balance provides a unique blend of code reusability and platform fidelity.

### Key Benefits of KMP
1. Code Reuse with Platform Flexibility
KMP allows you to write common business logic once and share it across platforms, reducing duplication and development time. At the same time, you can implement platform-specific UI and interactions, ensuring that your app feels native on both Android and iOS.

2. Native Performance
Unlike JavaScript-based frameworks, KMP compiles shared code to native binaries using Kotlin/Native for iOS and the JVM for Android. This results in high-performance apps that leverage each platform's full capabilities.

3. Leverage Existing Ecosystems
KMP integrates seamlessly with native development tools:

For Android: KMP works directly with Android Studio, Gradle, and Kotlin extensions.
For iOS: You can use Xcode and Swift alongside KMP-generated binaries.
4. Interoperability
KMP provides robust interoperability with both Java on Android and Swift/Objective-C on iOS, enabling you to integrate shared and native code effortlessly.

5. Future-Proof Solution
As Kotlin is officially supported by Google and widely adopted for Android, KMP aligns with the long-term direction of modern Android development. Its active community and JetBrains’ backing ensure continued innovation.

```markdown
| Feature               | Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) | Flutter             | React Native       | Xamarin            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Code Sharing Scope**| Business logic only       | Full app (UI & logic)| Full app (UI & logic)| Full app (UI & logic)|
| **Native UI**         | Platform-specific         | Custom (Skia engine)| Custom (Bridged)   | Bridged (native-like)|
| **Performance**       | Native                    | High (custom engine)| Moderate (bridged) | Moderate (bridged) |
| **Integration**       | Seamless with native tools| Requires custom setup| Requires custom setup| Tightly integrated|
| **Learning Curve**    | Low for Kotlin devs       | Moderate            | Low to moderate    | Moderate           |
```

### Why KMP is Better for Modern Teams

1. Focus on Native-Like User Experiences
Unlike Flutter and React Native, which use custom rendering engines, KMP encourages developers to craft native UIs for each platform. This ensures the app feels truly native, aligning with platform-specific design guidelines.

2. Incremental Adoption
You don’t need to rewrite your app to use KMP. It’s easy to adopt incrementally, sharing only selected modules like data access or networking while leaving existing code intact.

3. Shared Code Without Compromising Control
KMP provides the best of both worlds: code reuse where it matters (business logic) and full control over platform-specific implementations. This is ideal for teams that prioritize user experience.

4. Fewer External Dependencies
KMP uses Kotlin, which is already a familiar and powerful language for Android developers. There's no need to learn a new framework or deal with third-party dependencies for basic functionality.

### When to Choose KMP
KMP is ideal if:

- You already have an Android development team familiar with Kotlin.
- You need a shared codebase for business logic but want platform-specific UIs.
- Performance is critical, and you can't compromise with JavaScript-based solutions.
- You're migrating an existing codebase and prefer incremental adoption.

### Conclusion
Kotlin Multiplatform offers a pragmatic approach to cross-platform development, empowering developers to share code where it matters while crafting tailored, high-performance native experiences. Its seamless integration with native ecosystems, native performance, and incremental adoption make it a future-ready choice for teams looking to optimize their development processes. If you're building a new app or looking to reduce technical debt in an existing one, Kotlin Multiplatform might just be the game-changer you need.
