title: Execution Order in Jetpack Compose Explained with Analogies
layout: post
---

Understanding when `LaunchedEffect`, `DisposableEffect`, and composables run in Jetpack Compose can be tricky. Let‚Äôs simplify with a few real-world analogies.

### üé≠ Composables = Stage Actors

Composables are like actors:

- They enter when the screen appears.

- They update their lines when state changes (recomposition).

- They exit when removed from the UI.

### üïØÔ∏è LaunchedEffect = Candle in a Room

- You light a candle when entering a room ‚Üí `LaunchedEffect` runs.

- If the room changes (key changes), you blow it out and light a new one.

- If you leave, the candle is blown out.

- Use it for one-time effects or state collection.

### üßπ DisposableEffect = Hotel Housekeeping
- Housekeeper sets up the room ‚Üí `DisposableEffect` runs.

- When you check out (or key changes), the room is cleaned ‚Üí onDispose is called.

- Perfect for listeners or subscriptions that need cleanup.

### üîÑ Recomposition = Changing Actor‚Äôs Lines
If the script (state) changes, actors stay on stage but adjust their lines. No need to re-run effects unless keys change.

### Quick Comparison

| Concept          | Analogy      | When It Runs         | When It Cleans Up     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Composable       | Actor        | On screen draw/state | On removal            |
| LaunchedEffect   | Candle       | On enter/key change  | On key change/removal |
| DisposableEffect | Housekeeping | On enter/key change  | On key change/removal |


### ‚úÖ Final Tip
So next time you add a `LaunchedEffect` or a `DisposableEffect`, ask yourself:

- Is this a one-time action? ‚Üí Use `LaunchedEffect`.

- Does it need cleanup? ‚Üí Use `DisposableEffect`.

- Thinking this way makes Compose easier and your code cleaner.
