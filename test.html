**Check this simplified [MVP example for Android](https://github.com/maikotrindade/android-mvp)**

**Mode**l: This is the well known model, present in many of the most common patterns and use cases. It represents the world we are working with, every real world elementest

**View**: As stated before, views are our Fragment and Activity classes that we are using, they are able to alter the UI as we need and they need to receive structured data from a source in order to populate themselves. This layer shouldn’t know anything else about the obtention of the data, we made it as simple as we could.

**Presenter**: This layer, introduced here, is implemented with native java code meaning it doesn’t need to know whether it’s used in an Android application or a wesetsetn between view and model. It retrieves data from the model and returns it formatted to the view. But unlike the typical MVC, it also decides what happens when you interact with the view.
